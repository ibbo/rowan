## Tier 1 - High Impact üî•
**Implement First - Maximum User Value**

### 1. Intensity/Difficulty ‚≠ê ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-03)
- **Database Field:** `dance.intensity` (integer, 0-100+ scale)
- **Coverage:** 9,852 / 22,633 dances (43.5%)
- **Data Range:** 1 (easiest) to 100 (hardest), some outliers at 231
- **Difficulty Distribution:**
  - Easy (1-40): 342 dances
  - Medium (41-69): 6,407 dances
  - Hard (70+): 3,103 dances

**Use Cases:**
```
"Find easy dances for beginners"
"Show me challenging dances for experienced dancers"
"Medium difficulty reels"
"Dances with intensity less than 50"
```

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Added `min_intensity` parameter to `find_dances` tool
- ‚úÖ Added `max_intensity` parameter to `find_dances` tool

- ‚úÖ Intensity field included in search results
- ‚úÖ Unrated dances handled (intensity=-1 excluded when filtering with `d.intensity > 0`)

**Technical Notes:**
- Database uses `-1` for unrated dances (not NULL)
- Filtering automatically excludes unrated dances to provide meaningful results
- 12,774 dances are unrated (intensity=-1), 9,852 have ratings (intensity > 0)

---

### 2. Available Recordings üéº
- **Database Tables:** `recording`, `album` (via `dancesrecordingsmap`, `albumsrecordingsmap`)

- **Values:** 2341, 2413, OnceOnly, ChangePtnr, Canon, Becket, Nonprogressive, etc.

**Use Cases:**
```
"Find non-progressive dances"
"Show dances with 2341 progression"

- **Coverage:** 100%

**Use Cases:**
- Data quality filtering (probably internal use only)
- "Show only fully verified dances"

**Implementation:**
- Low priority - mainly for data quality assurance

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)
1. **Intensity/Difficulty** - Add to `find_dances` tool
2. **Recordings** - Add to `dance_detail` response (easy)
3. **Tunes** - Add to `dance_detail` response (easy)

### Phase 2: Search Enhancements (Week 2)
4. **Year Devised** - Add date range filters
5. **Devisor** - Add choreographer search
6. **Has Recording/Video** - Add boolean filters

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 3+)
7. **Progression Pattern** - For advanced users
8. **Notes Search** - Full-text search enhancement
9. **Diagrams/Videos** - Include in detail responses

---

## Technical Considerations

### Database Performance
- Most fields are indexed or in views (v_metaform, v_dances)
- Intensity filtering will need index on `dance.intensity`
- Date filtering may need index on `dance.devised`

### NULL Handling
- Many fields have NULL values (intensity: 57%, devised: 54%, etc.)
- Need clear documentation on NULL behavior
- Consider "has_intensity" filter for explicit NULL filtering

### API Design
- Keep `find_dances` tool focused, avoid parameter explosion
- Consider separate tools for specialized searches
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing parameters

### LLM Prompt Engineering
- Clear parameter descriptions crucial for LLM tool selection
- Include example queries in tool descriptions
- Use prominent keywords (e.g., "FILTER BY DIFFICULTY")

---

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Track which new filters are most used
- Monitor query success rates
- Gather user feedback on difficulty ratings

### Data Quality
- Identify dances missing key fields (intensity, recordings)
- Consider data enrichment efforts
- Track verification status improvements

---

## Future Enhancements

### Community Features
- User ratings/difficulty feedback
- Personal favorites/collections
- Dance recommendations based on skill level

### Music Integration
- Direct links to Spotify/YouTube recordings
- Tempo/BPM information
- Music style preferences

### Learning Paths
- Beginner ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced progressions
- Skill-based dance recommendations
- Formation complexity analysis
